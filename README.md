# Writespace

Writespace is a modern blogging platform that I have created using ReactJS and Appwrite. This platform provides a seamless writing and publishing experience, allowing users to create, manage, and share their blog posts easily.

## Features

- **Rich Text Editing**: Utilizes TinyMCE for a rich text editing experience, enabling users to format their blog posts effortlessly.
- **State Management**: Built with Redux Toolkit for efficient and scalable state management.
- **Form Handling**: Integrated with React Hook Form to handle form validation and submission.
- **Routing**: Implements client-side routing using React Router Dom, allowing for smooth navigation between pages.
- **API Integration**: Connects with Appwrite for backend services like user authentication, database management, and file storage.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with TailwindCSS for a fully responsive and mobile-friendly UI.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library used for building the user interface.
- **Appwrite**: Backend platform providing authentication, database, and storage services.
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management library to manage the application's global state.
- **TinyMCE React**: WYSIWYG editor for creating and editing content.
- **React Hook Form**: Library for managing form state and validation.
- **React Router Dom**: Routing library to handle navigation.
- **Vite**: Development environment for fast builds and hot module replacement.
